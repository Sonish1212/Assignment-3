***Question_number_1 (Tkinter Chat-app Application)***

***Overview***
This Tkinter Chat-app is designed with a focus on object-oriented programming principles, including multiple inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and method overriding.
The application facilitates communication between users in a room-based environment. The code structure is modular, ensuring clean and organized implementation.

***Features***
Server-Client Architecture:
Utilizes a server-client architecture allowing unlimited users to connect and chat in various rooms.

***Object-Oriented Programming Concepts:***

***Encapsulation***: Bundles related functionality and data within classes for better organization.

***Polymorphism***: Demonstrated through methods like send_message and receive_message tailored for server and client classes.

***Method Overriding***: Custom methods overridden in server and client classes based on specific requirements.

***Multiple Inheritance***: Inherits from Tkinter classes for GUI and socket-related classes for networking.

***Unlimited Users and Chat Rooms:***

Users can join chat rooms without limitations, fostering multiple discussions simultaneously.

***Usage***
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Sonish1212/Assignment-3/tree/main/Chat-bot

***Run the server script*:**
First  we have to run the server.py file to establish the connection 
python server.py
After running the file the server is activated and we have to run client script
***Run the client script:***
python client.py
Enter a username and select a chat room.

Start chatting with other users in the same room.

***Code Explanation***
Server and Client Classes:
-The Server and Client classes encapsulate server and client functionalities separately.
-Polymorphism is evident in methods like send_message and receive_message implemented differently for server and client.

***Socket Connections:***
-Utilizes socket programming for communication, showcasing multiple inheritance for handling GUI and networking aspects.
