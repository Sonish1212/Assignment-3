Chatbot is the application made using tkinter where we can communicate with each other connecting in a same server.
Here are two files present in chat bot server.py and chat.py 
*IMPORTANT*

Before running this file we have to understand that how can be run this file
Cause if we run chat file without server the file will crash
So first using terminal run server.py
Then open next terminal and run chat.py
You can open as much terminal you want and run chat.py and see how the chat is working
A simple tkinter application is used 
Add your name firstly and join and type message then message will be print in the message box.
*NOTE* 

Server file must be run first
